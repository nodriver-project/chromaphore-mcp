# Driving the Chromaphore browser

The browser tools act like a person at a real browser: the pointer travels to what it clicks, the wheel scrolls, keys are typed at a human pace. Pages see trusted input and an ordinary Chrome. That makes the tools right for reproducing what users hit; it also means actions take human time (a click about a second, typing about six characters a second).

## The loop

1. `browser_open` with the `url` to start on. Pick `headless: true` for background checks the user does not need to watch; leave it off when they want to see the browser, or when a site behaves differently without a window.
2. Act with `click`, `type`, `press`, `scroll`, `hover`, `navigate`. Each waits until the page has settled and answers with what changed: `+` lines appeared, `-` lines went, `~` lines changed (a value, a name, a state), plus focus, URL, scroll and announcements. That is usually all you need to plan the next step.
3. Call `observe` when you need the whole page again (after several changes, or a page you have not listed yet). Call `view` with a `snapshot_id` only when text is not enough: layout, images, colours, a canvas. It costs about 1,500 tokens.
4. `browser_close` when done. The profile stays on disk, unless it was `temp`.

Send calls whose targets you already know one after another without observing in between: a stale id is refused with the reason rather than acting on the wrong element.

## Ids and the listing

Each line starts with an id like `a12`, then the role, the accessible name in quotes, the value, the states that matter (focused, checked, disabled, required, invalid with the page's message), a link's destination, and where it is when not in view. `[red]` is the colour of its outline on the `view` screenshot. An id stays valid for the element's whole life in the document, across scrolls and listings.

Elements outside the view can be clicked directly: the click scrolls them in first. Elements marked covered cannot: close what covers them (a cookie banner, a dialog, a menu) first. `Open on top:` lines name dialogs, drawers and menus; with one open, only its contents are listed unless you observe with `scope: "all"`.

## Forms

- `type` with an `id` clicks into the field first. `clear: true` replaces what it holds; `submit: true` presses Enter after.
- Rare typos are typed and corrected like a person's, never in passwords, numbers, one-time codes or card fields. Use `exact: true` when even a corrected typo would matter (a field that validates on every key).
- Native controls have their own tools, which work them as a person does and check the result: `select` (by visible text or value; a wrong one is refused with the options there are), `fill_date` (`2024-05-03`, `14:30`, `2024-05-03T14:30`, `2024-05`, `2024-W18`), `pick_color` (`#rrggbb`), `upload` (absolute or working-folder paths; the field, its label or the button that opens it), `drag` (onto an element, a point, or a slider's `value`). Use them rather than typing into such fields.
- `paste` is quicker than `type` for long text and is a real paste to the page.
- The listing shows each field's value afterwards; check it rather than assuming.
- A JavaScript `alert`, `confirm` or `prompt` blocks the page: the action that opened it says so, and you answer with `dialog`.

## Reading state

`eval_js` evaluates an expression in the page and returns JSON: use it for application state, `localStorage`, computed values, or checking what the DOM holds. Do not use it to click or type: script events are not trusted input and miss what the page does on real input.

`fetch` reads a URL through the same browser (its cookies, fingerprint and network) without opening a tab: a page as Markdown, JSON or text as it is, or an API call with a method, headers and a body. Prefer it to navigating when you only need a page's content. It says when a bot challenge or a block got in the way.

`record_start` / `record_stop` capture everything the browser sends and receives, from inside it, to a folder with a HAR, a grep-able `requests.txt` and a `summary.md`. Use it to see which requests a page makes, what an API returned, or why something failed. The files hold cookies: keep them out of version control.

`screenshot` saves a PNG for the user or for a bug report (the model sees nothing); `view` is for you. `fingerprint` says what this launch shows sites about the machine.

## Profiles and fingerprints

`browser_open` answers with the profile path and the fingerprint seed. Pass `profile` back to reuse cookies and logins (for testing a signed-in flow, sign in once, then reuse the profile); pass `seed` back to keep the same fingerprint, which sites expect from a returning visitor. A fresh profile with a random seed is a first-time visitor.

For a one-off check you will not come back to, pass `profile: "temp"`: a fresh profile deleted when the browser closes, so test runs do not pile up profile folders. Its downloads and the files `fetch` saves go with it: copy out what you need before `browser_close`.

A profile can be open in one browser at a time.
